##Yet Another Milestone Management App

This is a simple client side angular.js app that aims to help developers get better at estimating how long stuff takes to code.

It will let developers add milestones that are ascociated with a ceratin completion time. (entered as, ie 5pm or 3 hours from now)

After defining multiple milestones it will allow the dev to mark them as completed.

After a mile stone is marked as completed, milestones that come after it will be automatically shifted forwards or backwards, depending on whether it took longer or shorter to reach the milstone in question
This will provide develpoers with a sliding estimate of when any future milestone (perhaps a bigger one that the boss wants) will be completed.

It will also allow developers to view a report with general info like, such as "You are way to optimistic with your predictions" or "You should stop gold bricking", along with data on which milestones took the longest or any multitude of other stuff you could say given the data.


##Things that should be done:
Let the developer navigate away from a page and then come back to it without deep sixing all milestones.


##If I drop out of school, loose my job, and finish watching all previous seasons of Family Guy, features I would work on include:

Creating some sort of backing database so that everything isn't just stored locally.

Perhaps create an admin dashboard in case the man wants to watch how people work.
